# SISE 2024 - task 1 - Game of Fifteen

This repository is dedicated to solving a Game of Fifteen various state space search strategies. It includes implementations for several algorithmic approaches designed to navigate and resolve the puzzle efficiently.

## Implemented Strategies

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** A layer-by-layer technique to explore the state space.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** A strategy that dives deep into possible solutions before backtracking.
- **A⭐️ Search:**
  - **A⭐️ with Hamming Distance Heuristic:** Utilizes Hamming distance to prioritize moves.
  - **A⭐️ with Manhattan Distance Heuristic:** Employs Manhattan distance for guiding the search.
